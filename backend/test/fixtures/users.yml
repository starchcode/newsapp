# Read about fixtures at https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html
# Note: For Devise, it's easier to create users in test setup using User.create!
# These fixtures are kept for reference but may not work with encrypted passwords
# Consider creating users dynamically in test setup instead

# one:
#   email: user1@example.com
#   encrypted_password: <will be set by Devise>

# two:
#   email: user2@example.com
#   encrypted_password: <will be set by Devise>
